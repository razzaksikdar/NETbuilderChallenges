# NETbuilderChallenges
It was a pleasure solving those testing challenges. 
A web format Test Report is generated for each and individual Test Case. 
Test Report is located in "Reporting" folder of each project.  
Test Project was developed and Executed in MacOS environment. To run the project in windows environment, we have to change
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/ARSIKDAR/Desktop/NETbuilder/BypassValidation/chromedriver"); to  System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/ARSIKDAR/Desktop/NETbuilder/BypassValidation/chromedriver.exe"); in each project (Line No: 29, TestCase.java).
